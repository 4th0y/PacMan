This is a simple PacMan game i pulled out of a guide, involving hashset, random, swing, etc packages.
Overall it's quite a bit more advanced, especially without anprior knowledge to hashset, but it's woth giving  a try ;). I have attached all of the pictures and the necessary driver and tester codes needed for this to work.
